## 📖 Description

Are you on a quest for a holistic metagenomic analysis using R? Look no further. Whether it's understanding diversity patterns, zeroing in on differential abundance, or crafting predictive models, the AD12122-RScript repository is your one-stop-shop.

## 📁 Data Requirements

- 🔍 Your data input must have **read counts** from the metagenomic samples.
- 🧼 Clean and well-formatted data ensures impeccable results. So, double-check for any missing values or irregularities before diving in.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Start by installing the necessary R packages using the `Packages.R` script.
2. Depending on your research quest, run the appropriate R script. E.g., for analyzing alpha diversity, head straight to the `Alpha Diversity.R` script.
3. Our scripts are peppered with inline comments. Ensure you glance through them for any script-specific guidelines.

## 📂 Files in the Repository

- **Packages.R**: One-stop solution to list and install the R packages crucial for all scripts housed here.
- **Phyloseq Object.R**: Your guide to creating and maneuvering a `phyloseq` object - a cornerstone in metagenomic analyses.
- **Relative Abundance.R**: A lens to gain swift visual insights into your data landscape.
- **Alpha Diversity.R**: Delve deep into the rich patterns of alpha diversity in your dataset.
- **Beta Diversity.R**: Tools crafted to evaluate beta diversity nuances across various samples/groups.
- **Differential Abundance.R**: A compass to pinpoint taxa that stand out between groups.
- **Modelling.R**: A toolkit to sculpt predictive models anchored in your metagenomic findings.
